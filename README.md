# Image Color Extractor & Palette Generator

Hi! This project lets you upload any image and quickly see the **top 10 colors** in it. It shows each color with its **HEX code** and the **percentage** of the image it covers. The dominant color is highlighted, and you can even **download a palette image** of all the colors — super handy for designers or anyone working with color schemes.
